> If no `store_code` is provided, the API returns inventory positions for all stores in the database. Use the pagination parameters (`page` and `size`) to limit the number of inventory records returned in a single response.
> If `product_stock_date` is not provided, the API defaults to the most recent stock date available in the database. If an store do not have inventory data for the most recent stock date, it will not be included in the response.
> If `sku` is not provided, the API returns inventory positions for all SKUs.

### Returns:
- store_code - `string`
- cnpj - `string`
- sku - `string`
- product_stock_date - `date`
- product_stock_quantity - `integer`

### SKU Information: 
> A Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a unique alphanumeric code assigned to products by retailers to track inventory internally. SKUs identify specific product attributes like brand, style, color, and size (e.g., TSH-BLK-08 for a black T-shirt, size 8). Unlike universal barcodes, SKUs are customized by each company to manage stock, analyze sales trends, and improve warehouse efficiency.

### CNPJ Information:
- CNPJ stands for Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica (National Registry of Legal Entities) in Brazil. It is a 14-digit, mandatory federal tax identification number (formatted XX.XXX.XXX/XXXX-XX) issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service to companies, branches, and organizations for legal, tax, and commercial operations. It is used for tax reporting, invoicing, and legal identification of businesses in Brazil.
- To make it simple, the API returns only the digits of the `cnpj` without formatting.
- This column can serve as a unique identifier of an store.
